        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Sam Matthews. 
            I want to pursue a career in software development because I enjoy solving 
            problems and I gain satisfaction from creating things that other people can use and 
            benefit from. Since September 2019 I have been developing my code abilities, primarily
            in Python, and I created this page to showcase what I've learned.
        </p>

        <p>Python</p>

        <p>I volunteer for <a href="https://digilocal.org.uk/">DigiLocal</a>, a registered charity 
            that holds free tech clubs for young 
            people, with a focus on supporting those from groups that are under-represented within 
            the tech industry. At DigiLocal clubs children learn to code by creating games and 
            animations in Python and Scratch. As a Digilocal Ambassador I provide supervision and 
            support for the young people as they tackle their projects, assisting them with problem 
            solving and debugging their code. Beyond my usual role I have developed and contributed 
            my own projects to DigiLocal's library and supported DigiLocal teams at the Bristol 
            NASA space apps challenge 2019. I really enjoy helping at DigiLocal as the children 
            find the content engaging and it's an experience that I would have enjoyed as a child.</p>
        

        <p>I also volunteered as a 'Digital Champion' for 
            <a href="https://www.leonardcheshire.org/">Leonard Cheshire Disability</a>, a charity 
            that provides many services for people with mental and physical disabilities. People 
            with disabilities have a disproportionately high rate of computer illiteracy, which 
            in addition to their conditions can make interacting with the world especially 
            challenging. My role was to educate clients in a wide range of IT basics including 
            use of a mouse and keyboard, Microsoft Office and safe use of the internet.</p>
