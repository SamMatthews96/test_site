        <p>This page showcases a number of my personal favourite python projects I have completed. 
        They are made using the pygame library and are mostly games or puzzles I made for 
        DigiLocal. I haven't found a way of making them play within a browser, so I'll
        provide links to repl.it </p>

            <p>This game generates a random planar network with a certain number of nodes 
                and randomises their position. The objective is to click and drag the nodes 
                until none of the edges are crossed.

            <p>Based on a board game. Upon starting the game the computer will generate 4 randomly 
                coloured circles in a particular order, which are hidden from the user. The objective 
                is to figure out what the colour and position of the circles is. To make a guess, click 
                on a circle on the top unfilled row and press a number from 1-6. Each number corresponds 
                to a colour as indicated by the key on the right side of the window. Once a row has been 
                filled you can submit your guess. The game will give feedback indicating how close your 
                guess is by displaying a number of black and white dots at the end of the row. Each 
                black dot indicates that a circle was of the correct colour and in the correct position. 
                Each white dot indicates that a circle was of the correct colour and in the wrong position. 
                The user has 10 guesses before they lose. Upon winning or losing the game will display 
            the correct solution.</p>

        <h1>Roguelike</h1>
        <p>Work in progress. This project was an attempt to try and create line of sight in a 2d game. 
            The program creates an environment made of walls and floors. Walls block the users line of 
            sight, but moving around the game space (with WASD) will reveal the map. Performance is 
        currently lacking and there are a number of improvements that can be made..</p>

        <h1>Sudoku Solver</h1>
        <p>Solves Sudoku puzzles up to those that are rated "hard". Clicking on a square will select 
            it, and entering a number from 1-9 will enter that value into the square. Each time the 
        user input a number the program will eliminate redundant candidates to solve the puzzle.</p>
